In this project, I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Applied multiple machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),  Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Decision Tree to predict machine downtime. 
Among all models tested, the Decision Tree model achieved the highest accuracy.
